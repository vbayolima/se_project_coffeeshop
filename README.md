- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- iframe

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :
in the future, I plan on figuring out how to extend the header page so that no blue from the recipes page shows (without breaking the header-footer). Will also make a color transformation when hovering over the nav bar. I also plan on implementing a type of animation somewhere on the webpage (tbd where).
