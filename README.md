# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
This website consists of six sections, including the header and footer. It is meant to represent a coffee shop inside Practicum's library. In this webpage, the user can look through the cafe's menu, watch recipes for making coffee, reserve a table, and contact Practicum.
The header/home page has a navigation bar so that the user can go straight to where they want to go in the webpage without having to scroll. This was made possible by connecting the section's identifier to the corresponding navigation link. The links also change color when the user hovers over it since there is a transition property applied in CSS.
The recipes section was made using iframes. This allows the user to watch recipes from youtube directly in the webpage. They can also pause/unpause the video. As well as, control the video's volume, captions, settings, and make the video fullscreen. This was all done through iframes.
In the reservations section, the user can book a table by filling out a form with their name, number of guests, date/time, and email. This was made with the form and fieldset elements. The form also features a submission button and a checkbox button. The submit button changes color when the user hovers over it due to a transition property applied to change its opacity. All fields of the form are required in order to submit.
The menu allows the user to browse through the different beverages and goods the coffee shop has to offer. The menu was organized through flexbox and many flexbox properties, such as justify-content, flex-direction, flex-wrap, gap, etc.
The about section provides a description of the coffeeshop and their mission. This section also features a pulsing animation, created using the keyframes at-rule and animation property. In the keyframes at-rule, the about\_\_circle div class was scaled to be 1.3 times bigger and have the opacity appear and disappear over the course of the animation (1.3 seconds). The animation loops an infinite amount of times.
The footer contains the Practicum logo, links to Practicum's facebook and instagram, as well as a copyright logo to show the creater of the webpage and the year it was created. The links to social media accounts change colors over a period of one second when the user hovers over it.

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, I would like to experiment with different fonts, while still maintaining a professional look.
I would also like to add another pulsating animation, this time in the footer. It would have the same features as the one in the about section. The only difference is where it is positioned. I would like it to be diaganol to the one in the about section, at the bottom right of the footer. I believe it would create a nice design since the footer and about section look like they could be one page.
